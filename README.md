# password-generator

the is a secure password generator I decided to make. please feel free to download it is in python 2.7.  It will also save all your passwords to a file with what you intend to use it, for for you so you do not need to worry about having to copy and paste it into a txt file. The file is called Passwords file and is saved in the same folder as wher ethe program is.  So hopefully you guys will have more secure passwords now.
